ALGORITHM SequentialSearch2(A[0..n], K)
//Implements sequential search with a search key as a sentinel
//Input: An array A of n elements and a search key K
//Output: The index of the first element in A[0..n -1] whose value is
// equal to K or -1 if no such element is found
A[n]<--K
i <-- 0
while A[i] != K do
i <-- i + 1
if i<n return i
else return -1
